1. Run setup.sql to install the database
2. Load up dmvs.sql in order to observe any latch waits
3. Run repro.cmd
4. Look for 
5. Run debugsql.cmd to attach the debugger
6. Run dd "<resource address>"
7. Show the breakdown of the class and look at the bytes

The first 64bits is the waiter list
The second 64bits is the owner’s task address
The next 64bits is the m_count. Break this down into bits and show the EX bit and waiters bit set. This should be 0xa
The next 64bits is the class. 0x30 is 48 decimal which internally means the FGCB_ADD_REMOVE class

Copy the task address from the debugger window (byte swap it) and find the task address in the DMV output still in SSMS. 
Which one is it. The one waiting on PREEMPTIVE_OS_WRITEFILEGATHER.

8. What is this scenario?
